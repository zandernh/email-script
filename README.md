# email-script
I created a little email script in Python 3.11 that allows you to send out multiple emails at once. I would advise you to use a throw-away email address for testing purposes just to be extra cautious regarding your personal information. 

Full security was not the focus of this project, merely granting the ability to send out emails to an extensive list. That being said, you should be fine using the script provided you are testing the script without showing your codebase. 

Use case example: 
Internal company employee memo.
